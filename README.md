<h2>Program Overview</h2>
<p>This program is used to see the relative efficacy of zero, one, two, and three-bit branch prediction algorithms. It will print the number of correct
predictions to the console.</p>
<p>NOTE: In order to run this program, a sanitized text file of memory locations and branch results must be provided. text.txt has been included in this repository for convenience,
which was originally created by Professor Jason Hibbeler for CS 3220: Computer Architecture at UVM.</p>
